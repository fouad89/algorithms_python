# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

# 1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
# 2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
# These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.


# Function Description

# Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

# getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

# int a[n]: an array of integers
# int b[m]: an array of integers

# Design:
# Input
## a[n], b[m] two int arrays with n & m sizes respectively

# output
## number of integers that satisfy both condtions (elems of a all divisible by number, and all elems of b are divisible by number)
